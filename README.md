## SVG-Logo-Maker
## Overview
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## User Story
AS a freelance web developer, I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Technologies Used
Node.js
Inquirer
Jest

## Usage

Enter up to three characters for the text.
Choose a color for the text (keyword provided).
Select a shape from the list: circle, triangle, or square.
Choose a color for the shape (keyword provided).

## Output

An SVG file named logo.svg is generated.
The output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
Open the logo.svg file in a browser to view the generated logo.
